# Prediction-of-Hotel-Reservation-Cancellation

# Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts hotel booking cancellations. Utilizing a Kaggle dataset, we explored factors such as booking details and customer requests to identify cancellation likelihood. Our model aims to help hotels optimize operations and enhance customer service.

# Repository Structure
data/: The dataset used for training and testing the models.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks containing exploratory data analysis and modeling.

# Model Performance
Our Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 89% on the test set. When applied to a secondary, similar dataset, it maintained a robust accuracy of 84%, validating our model's generalizability.

# Getting Started
To replicate or build upon our findings:

# Clone this repository.
Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
Explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the modeling process.
